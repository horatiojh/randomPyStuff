# randomPyStuff
The repository for all my random Python projects, where I try to automate things to make it easier to do stuff and to save time. Everything here is free for use, and feedback/comments are much appreciated. Please feel free to fork and make the code your own, or even contribute new ideas to these projects! 

## Projects in the Repo
### Library Scrape
This is a script that I'm writing to check the NLB's catalogue for the books that I want to borrow. Given a number of book URLs in the catalogue, as well as a selected library, the script will check the catalogue and return the status of books in that particular library, from number of copies available to the status of the unavailable copies. 

### Scraping project
This is a script that searches the ShareInvestor website based on a bunch of URLS and pulls the stock name and price, then exports it to an excel file.
